# desipano

This repo hosts a [static website](https://dkirkby.github.io/desipano/) that serves 360-degree panoramas of the DESI focal plane, using the [panellum library](https://pannellum.org/) to implement a virtual-reality tour.  The source images are rendered using Blender.

The tour should work on all modern browsers, including on phones and tablets. To advertise it, there is a poster you can display in [US letter](https://github.com/dkirkby/desipano/raw/main/poster-us-letter.jpg) or [A4](https://github.com/dkirkby/desipano/raw/main/poster-a4.jpg) format:
